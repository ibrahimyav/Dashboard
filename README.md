# Project Description
This project is a management dashboard built using Vue.js, Firebase, and Quasar. The goal of the project is to provide an efficient way for charity and non-profit organizations to manage and monitor their data, allowing them to make better decisions and presentations at meetings. It is specifically designed for non-profit organizations (NPOs) and is unique in its ability to display multiple projects and programs in a single, user-friendly interface. With Firebase as the back-end, this dashboard is also cost-effective and practical for NPOs with limited incomes.
